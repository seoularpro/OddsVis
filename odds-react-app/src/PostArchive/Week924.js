                    Angles and curves.  At its core, football can be broken down to physics and geometry.  We have Derrick Henry running through you with Bucky Irving repeatedly cutting back across the entire field.  What is a route other than a redirection angle.  Space and volume.  Within music, the absence of sound is arguably more important than moments saturated with sound.  Paralleled with the NFL as players on offense have a primary objective to fill empty space through avoiding defenders.  Legitimately every physical sport and virtual esport are predicated by human beings attempting to find the "best" angles and curves.  Maybe even the root of life in itself.

                    Another fresh wave of data points from last week, obviously some more telling than others.  I just traded Devonta Smith for Ladd McConkey and Josh Downs, due to a firm belief in the significance of their week 8 performances, and Flacco's immortality.  Back to the main objective, we are purely focused on predicting week 9's outcome.  Does data from week 1 and 2 even matter anymore?  You need to be constantly devaluing fantasy data, as time goes on.  As you delve deeper into the past, each week's data becomes increasingly less significant for fantasy purposes.  Yet, Alvin Kamara's 43 point week 2 performance isn't even his career ceiling.  I'd imagine that 43 has significance.  One above 42 the meaning of life, as the supercomputer from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy would claim.

                    Forget about making these significance estimates on your own.  <a class="underline" href="https://www.VegasProjections.com">VegasProjections.com</a> has weekly median projections dictated by advanced math models factoring in nearly every aspect/angle we aren't aware of.  In evidence of a stronger system that outperforms Vegas's models, a rapid adjustment mechanism guarantees restoration of profitability equilibrium.  The primary driving force behind the lucrativity of sportsbooks.

                    **Derrick Henry is missing his reception prop but is at 13.75 without it.  Ja'Marr as well at 11.85.  All values except Aaron Jones and Kenneth Walker are from consensus projections.

                    This week we see that Kyler has risen to elite orange status, regardless of the new Call of Duty release.  A potential under bet?  Given his history of failure post Call of Duty release.  Mahomes is flying up the rankings, making us question if the old Patty is back (in terms of fantasy value).  While the Kansas City defense rightfully has stifled Baker's value.  At the top of the board is a large grouping of elite running backs with similar monster 16 point projections, causing no running back to have a red valuation (colors are determined by percentile within players on the current page).  You may want to prioritize efforts to acquire anyone in this grouping, an epiphany I recently reached, or else fall behind.  The top five running backs all outproject the top WR with CeeDee at 15.71.  Having an elite reciever at this moment is an extreme positional advantage (in no order CeeDee, JJ, ARSB, AJB, Malik, Ja'Marr).  If you're wondering what Vegas thinks about Diontae's value in Baltimore, they're clueless as well.  Kelce might be his old self again, and Njoku is apparently reaching his potential.   </p>

                    As always, thank you all for the support.  Incredibly, out of over 300 hits to the sportsbook affiliate link, not a single person has actually made an account.  Kudos, as I repeatedly stress to be careful betting against Vegas. I just have the link there so that the occasional individual refusing to acknowledge the site figure's veracity has an easy outlet to put their money where their mouth is.  Which I respect, as long as you have strong statistical data or historic accuracy backing up your wagers.  Test your systems on the past 8 weeks for concept validation.  Vegas is not perfect, and if you are determined enough, you can find profitable edges.  Yet be warned, sportsbooks notoriously cheat by limiting super profitable customers, so mastery of sportsbetting goes hand in hand with a life of rotating sportsbooks worldwide, through a wide array of devious techniques.

                    As a final reminder, remember these are median projections, not mean projections.  Mentally elevate values on players with higher ceilings, as outliers are not captured in the median as much as the mean, which is the true score projection.
